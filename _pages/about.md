Hello! I'm a postdoc at UC Berkeley EECS, working with [Yun S. Song](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yss/).
My main interests are applications of machine learning and artificial intelligence in genomics.

I received my PhD in Computational Biology at UC Berkeley and my Licentiate degree in Computer Science at the University of Buenos Aires.
Previously, I worked as a software engineer at Urbansim and Autodesk.
